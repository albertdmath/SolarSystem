# CS559-Three -  a version of the THREE.js library for CS559 Workbooks

**This is the Spring24 version!**

These files are taken from the THREE distribution. 

They are the pieces that are required for the CS559 workbooks. This is the minimum.
If you want other things (like the sources or the documentations or examples), download the entire three package.

What's here (all copied from the THREE distribution):
1. The Three README.md and LICENSE files (renamed)
1. `build/three.module.js`
1. the src folder (mainly to get the typing information)
1. some of the examples (not all of them) - all from the jsm folder
1. the fonts (just the json for helvetiker)
