<p><strong>Short version:</strong> Make a &ldquo;town&rdquo; in the world on the 
    <a href="../../for_students/gr-01-01.html" class="for_students">gr-01-01.html</a> page in the workbook. Get points for making things. Document what you do on <a href="../../docs/2/">Page  2  (Graphics Town Overview)</a>. If it&rsquo;s cool, you&rsquo;ll get a good grade.</p>

<p><strong>Why is there a long version?</strong> Students often want to know &ldquo;how much do I need to make?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;how cool does it have to be?&rdquo; But, we want to make things be flexible because students can be <strong>very</strong> creative, and we want to encourage that.</p>
<p>The hard part is quantifying “enough” and “cool”. We might say “you’ll know it when you see it.” But instead, we have to try to write something…</p>
<p>There are a bunch of pages explaining what you should do.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must document (in <strong>p2-workbook.txt</strong>) what you do in order to get credit.</li>
<li>Add any files that you create to the repository.</li>
<li>Push early and often - it provides a backup in case something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Be aware of the collaboration policy.</li>
<li>Keep the user interface on 
    <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students">final-grtown.html</a> - you can add things to it, but we need the functions to work.</li>
<li>Be careful to keep performance reasonable, and not to make your repository be too huge.</li>
<li>Complete the Canvas Assignment when you are done (and have committed and pushed)</li>
</ol>
<p>Within the workbook, there is 
    <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.html" class="for_students">final-grtown.html</a> page and its associated 
    <a href="../../for_students/final-grtown.js" class="for_students">final-grtown.js</a>. This is where your town goes. There is also an <code>examples</code> directory, which gives you some sample stuff to get started.</p>
<p>We have given you a basic &ldquo;world&rdquo; to start. It is really more of a collection of random objects than a &ldquo;town.&rdquo; You may use these objects in your town, but you should arrange things in a more meaningful manner. In fact, you should not use the <code>main</code> function that we provide as an example. Note that one of the &ldquo;basic requirements&rdquo; is that your assignment &ldquo;is visually distinct from the example provided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You need to highlight some of <strong>your</strong> objects. As an example, we have highlighted some of our objects - but you can only highlight objects that you created. Be sure to remove the highlighting of our objects.</p>
